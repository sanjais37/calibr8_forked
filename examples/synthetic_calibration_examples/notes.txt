0. Load the CALIBR8 environment:
  > cd $CALIBR8_ROOT
  > source env/osx-shared.sh 
  > source capp-setup.sh
  > capp load

  (now it's safe to navigate to where you'll run the model problems)

1. gmsh + gmodel
  - notes on format. skip details for now

2. forward -> edited from the notch2D_small_J2_plane_stress test:
  - "write synthetic: true" in problem block
  - quantity of interest: reaction mismatch
  - remove regression test
  - make the DBC larger
  - change the model parameters

  > primal notch2D_small_J2_plane_stress.yaml
    - this will generate the "synthetic" displacement and load measurements

2. pdeco inverse:
  > inverse pdeco_notch2D_small_J2_plane_stress.yaml

3. vfm inverse:
  > inverse vfm_notch2D_small_J2_plane_stress.yaml
